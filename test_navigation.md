# Customizable Navigation Implementation Summary

## Implementation Complete âœ…

I've successfully implemented a customizable favorites navigation system for students as requested. Here's what was added:

### 1. **Navigation Models & Services**
- **NavItem Model** (`lib/models/nav_item.dart`): Represents navigation items with id, title, route, icons, category, and roles
- **NavigationService** (`lib/services/navigation_service.dart`): Manages available navigation items and favorites persistence using SharedPreferences
- **NavigationProvider** (`lib/providers/navigation_provider.dart`): State management for navigation favorites with role-based filtering

### 2. **Customizable Navigation UI**
- **FavoritesNavBar** (`lib/widgets/common/favorites_nav_bar.dart`): Replaces the static BottomNavBar with a customizable version
- **CustomizeNavFab**: Floating action button for students to customize their navigation
- **NavigationCustomizationSheet**: Bottom sheet UI for selecting and managing favorites

### 3. **Key Features**
- Students can customize their bottom navigation with 4 favorite items
- Visual preview of selected favorites with drag-and-drop style interface
- Category filtering (General, Academic, Communication, Planning, etc.)
- Favorites persist across app sessions using SharedPreferences
- Role-based navigation items (different options for teachers vs students)
- Default favorites based on user role

### 4. **Navigation Items Available**

**For Students:**
- Dashboard
- Courses
- Assignments
- Grades
- Messages
- Calendar
- Notifications
- Discussions
- Settings

**For Teachers:**
- Dashboard
- Classes
- Gradebook
- Assignments
- Students
- Analytics
- Messages
- Calendar
- Notifications
- Discussions
- Settings

### 5. **User Experience**
- Students see an edit button (pencil icon) in the bottom right corner
- Tapping it opens a customization sheet showing:
  - Current 4 favorites at the top
  - Category filters
  - Full list of available navigation items
  - Star icons to add/remove favorites
- Changes are saved and persist across app sessions

The implementation addresses your request to "make those 4 buttons customizable so they can act as a students' favorites" while maintaining a clean and intuitive interface.
