# Zep Cloud Integration for Teacher Dashboard Flutter

## Overview

Zep Cloud has been successfully integrated into the teacher-dashboard-flutter-firebase project to provide advanced development context management and memory capabilities. This integration helps track:

- Development decisions and architectural choices
- Code changes and their rationale
- TODO items and priorities
- Error contexts and resolutions
- Project evolution over time

## What Was Set Up

### 1. Environment Configuration
- **API Key**: Configured in `.env` file as `ZEP_API_KEY`
- **MCP Server**: Configured in `.mcp.json` pointing to the local zep-cloud MCP server

### 2. Python Scripts Created

#### `zep_dev_context.py`
Main development context manager with methods for:
- `add_development_decision()`: Track architectural and design decisions
- `track_code_change()`: Record significant code modifications
- `add_todo_item()`: Manage development tasks
- `add_error_context()`: Document errors and their resolutions
- `search_context()`: Query stored development history

#### `test_zep_cloud_mcp.py`
Test script that verifies:
- Client connectivity to Zep Cloud API
- User management operations
- Graph search functionality
- Data storage capabilities

### 3. User Setup
- Project user ID: `teacher-dashboard-flutter`
- Metadata includes project type and description
- Already contains initial development context entries

## How to Use

### Recording Development Decisions
```python
from scripts.zep_dev_context import DevContextManager

manager = DevContextManager()
manager.add_development_decision(
    decision_type="architecture",
    description="Chose Firebase Realtime Database for chat instead of Firestore",
    context={
        "reason": "Lower latency for real-time messaging",
        "alternatives_considered": ["Firestore", "WebSocket server"]
    }
)
```

### Tracking Code Changes
```python
manager.track_code_change(
    file_path="lib/features/chat/data/services/chat_service.dart",
    change_type="refactor",
    description="Extracted message encryption logic into separate service",
    code_snippet="class EncryptionService { ... }"
)
```

### Managing TODOs
```python
manager.add_todo_item(
    task="Implement message read receipts",
    priority="high",
    category="feature"
)
```

### Documenting Errors
```python
manager.add_error_context(
    error_message="FirebaseException: [auth/invalid-credential]",
    file_path="lib/features/auth/data/services/auth_service.dart",
    resolution="Updated Firebase Auth configuration and regenerated OAuth credentials"
)
```

### Searching Development History
```python
# Find all architecture decisions
results = manager.search_context("architecture decision", limit=10)

# Find all high-priority todos
results = manager.get_todos()

# Find error history
results = manager.get_error_history()
```

## MCP Server Status

The Zep Cloud MCP server is configured but may not be automatically loaded by Claude Code. The server provides tools for:
- Creating and managing users
- Adding data to the graph
- Searching the knowledge graph
- Retrieving user information

## Current Data

The project already contains:
- Architecture decision about using Provider for state management
- Code change tracking for calendar provider implementation
- TODO for implementing offline support
- Error context for Firestore permission issues

## Benefits

1. **Persistent Memory**: Development decisions and context persist across sessions
2. **Searchable History**: Quickly find past decisions, errors, and solutions
3. **Team Knowledge**: Share development context across team members
4. **AI-Enhanced Development**: Claude can access this context for better assistance

## Next Steps

1. Regularly use the context manager to document important decisions
2. Search the graph before making architectural changes
3. Track error resolutions to build a knowledge base
4. Use the TODO tracking for project management

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:
1. Verify the API key in `.env` is correct
2. Check that the Zep Cloud Python SDK is installed: `pip install zep-cloud`
3. Ensure the MCP server path in `.mcp.json` is correct
4. Test connectivity with: `python scripts/test_zep_cloud_mcp.py`
