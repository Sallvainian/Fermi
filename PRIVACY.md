### Firebase Services
We use Firebase (owned by Google) for all backend services. Firebase's privacy practices are governed by [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

## Data Sharing

We do not sell or share your personal information with third parties. Information is only visible to:
