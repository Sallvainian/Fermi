   ```

3. **Firebase Configuration**
   ```bash
   # Install Firebase CLI
   npm install -g firebase-tools

   # Login to Firebase
   firebase login

   # Initialize Firebase (if needed)
   flutterfire configure --project=teacher-dashboard-flutterfire
   ```

   ```env
   GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
   GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
   ```

5. **Platform-Specific Setup**

   **iOS**:
   - Place `GoogleService-Info.plist` in `ios/Runner/`
   - Configure Sign in with Apple in Xcode

   **Web**:
   - Firebase config is embedded in `web/index.html`

### Running the Application

```bash
# Web (recommended for development)
flutter run -d chrome

# Android
flutter run -d android

# iOS (macOS only)
flutter run -d ios

# Windows
flutter run -d windows

# List all available devices
flutter devices
```

### Building for Production

```bash
# Web
flutter build web --release

# Android APK
flutter build apk --release

# Android App Bundle
flutter build appbundle --release

# iOS
flutter build ios --release

# Windows
flutter build windows --release
```

## 🔥 Firebase Configuration

### Firestore Database Structure

```javascript
// Users Collection
users/{userId} {
  email: string,
  displayName: string,
  role: "teacher" | "student" | "parent" | "admin",
  createdAt: timestamp,
  emailVerified: boolean,
  profileImageUrl?: string,
  settings?: object
}

// Classes Collection
classes/{classId} {
  teacherId: string,
  name: string,
  subject: string,
  gradeLevel: string,
  enrollmentCode: string,
  studentIds: string[],
  createdAt: timestamp,
  academicYear: string,
  isArchived: boolean
}

// Assignments Collection
assignments/{assignmentId} {
  classId: string,
  teacherId: string,
  title: string,
  description: string,
  dueDate: timestamp,
  points: number,
  status: "draft" | "published" | "closed",
  attachments?: string[],
  rubric?: object
}

// Behavior Points Collection
behaviorPoints/{pointId} {
  studentId: string,
  teacherId: string,
  classId: string,
  points: number,
  category: string,
  description: string,
  createdAt: timestamp,
  isPositive: boolean
}

// Grades Collection
grades/{gradeId} {
  studentId: string,
  assignmentId: string,
  classId: string,
  score: number,
  maxScore: number,
  feedback?: string,
  submittedAt: timestamp,
  gradedAt: timestamp
}

// Messages Collection
messages/{messageId} {
  senderId: string,
  recipientIds: string[],
  content: string,
  timestamp: timestamp,
  readBy: object,
  attachments?: string[]
}

// Discussion Boards Collection
discussionBoards/{boardId} {
  classId: string,
  title: string,
  description: string,
  createdBy: string,
  createdAt: timestamp,
  posts: subcollection
}
```

### Security Rules

The application implements comprehensive Firestore security rules that ensure:

- **Authentication Required**: All database access requires authentication
- **Role-Based Access**: Teachers, students, and parents have different permissions
- **Data Isolation**: Users can only access their authorized data
- **Email Verification**: Sensitive operations require verified email
- **Domain Validation**: School email domains are enforced
- **Write Protection**: Only authorized users can modify data

Example security rule pattern:
```javascript
match /classes/{classId} {
  allow read: if request.auth != null &&
    (isTeacher() || isStudentInClass(classId));
  allow write: if request.auth != null &&
    isTeacher() && request.auth.uid == resource.data.teacherId;
}
```
