# iOS Build Fix Summary - GOOGLE_APP_ID Configuration

## Issue
The app was showing "Configuration fails. It may be caused by an invalid GOOGLE_APP_ID" error even though GoogleService-Info.plist had been updated with the correct App ID.

## Root Cause
The GoogleService-Info.plist file was not properly added to the Xcode project's build resources. While the file existed in the file system at `/ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist`, it was not included in the Xcode project structure.

## Changes Made

### 1. GoogleService-Info.plist Content (Already Correct)
- **GOOGLE_APP_ID**: `1:218352465432:ios:33fe51117562f8d938b56d` ✅
- **BUNDLE_ID**: `com.academic-tools.fermi` ✅
- Location: `/ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist`

### 2. Xcode Project Configuration (Fixed)
Modified `/ios/Runner.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` to:
- Added file reference for GoogleService-Info.plist
- Added GoogleService-Info.plist to the Runner group
- Added GoogleService-Info.plist to the Resources build phase
- This ensures the file is properly copied to the app bundle during build

### 3. Clean and Rebuild
- Ran `flutter clean` to remove all build artifacts
- Ran `flutter pub get` to restore dependencies
- Ran `pod install --repo-update` to update iOS CocoaPods

## Verification
- Old App ID `1:218352465432:ios:828a5d537da284df38b56d` is not found anywhere in the codebase
- New App ID `1:218352465432:ios:33fe51117562f8d938b56d` is correctly set in GoogleService-Info.plist
- GoogleService-Info.plist is now properly included in the Xcode project

## Next Steps
1. Open Xcode and verify GoogleService-Info.plist appears in the project navigator under Runner folder
2. Build and run the app on iOS simulator or device
3. The Firebase configuration error should now be resolved

## Additional Notes
- Info.plist does not contain GOOGLE_APP_ID (this is normal - it's read from GoogleService-Info.plist)
- No xcconfig files contain hardcoded App IDs (good practice)
- Firebase SDK v12.0.0 is being used as configured
