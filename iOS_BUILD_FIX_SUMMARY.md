# iOS Build Fix Summary

## Problem
The iOS GitHub Actions workflow was creating an archive (`Runner.xcarchive`) but failing to generate an IPA file. The `flutter build ipa` command would complete without errors but no IPA would be found in `build/ios/ipa/`.

## Root Cause
Based on extensive research, this is a known issue with `flutter build ipa` when using manual signing in CI/CD environments. The command often fails silently during the export phase even when the archive is created successfully. This happens because:

1. **Export Options Mismatch**: The `flutter build ipa` command doesn't always properly handle the ExportOptions.plist configuration, especially with manual signing
2. **Provisioning Profile Issues**: Manual signing requires precise configuration that Flutter's build command doesn't always handle correctly
3. **CI Environment Limitations**: Automatic signing only works on local development machines, not in CI environments like GitHub Actions

## Solution Implemented

### Two Workflow Files Created:

#### 1. **Updated Original Workflow** (`03_mobile_builds.yml`)
- Added fallback mechanism: if `flutter build ipa` fails to create IPA, it automatically falls back to manual xcodebuild commands
- Improved ExportOptions.plist configuration with all required keys
- Enhanced verification and debugging output
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing approach

#### 2. **New Fixed Workflow** (`03_mobile_builds_fixed.yml`)
- Uses the proven two-step approach:
  1. Build with Flutter WITHOUT code signing: `flutter build ios --release --no-codesign`
  2. Archive and export with xcodebuild directly with manual signing parameters
- This approach is more reliable for CI/CD environments
- Cleaner and more maintainable code structure

## Key Changes Made

### 1. ExportOptions.plist Configuration
```xml
<key>method</key>
<string>app-store</string>
<key>teamID</key>
<string>W778837A9L</string>
<key>signingStyle</key>
<string>manual</string>
<key>signingCertificate</key>
<string>Apple Distribution</string>
<key>provisioningProfiles</key>
<dict>
    <key>com.academic-tools.fermi</key>
    <string>Fermi Distribution</string>
</dict>
```

### 2. Two-Step Build Process
```bash
# Step 1: Build without signing
flutter build ios --release --no-codesign

# Step 2: Archive with manual signing
xcodebuild -workspace ios/Runner.xcworkspace \
  -scheme Runner \
  -archivePath build/ios/Runner.xcarchive \
  archive \
  DEVELOPMENT_TEAM="W778837A9L" \
  PROVISIONING_PROFILE_SPECIFIER="ede95ddf-94d6-469c-ad53-0ea48951dc16"

# Step 3: Export IPA
xcodebuild -exportArchive \
  -archivePath build/ios/Runner.xcarchive \
  -exportPath build/ios/ipa \
  -exportOptionsPlist ios/ExportOptions.plist
```

## Why This Works

1. **Separation of Concerns**: By separating the Flutter build from the signing/archiving process, we avoid Flutter's issues with manual signing
2. **Direct Control**: Using xcodebuild directly gives us full control over the signing process
3. **CI-Friendly**: This approach is specifically designed for CI/CD environments where automatic signing isn't available
4. **Proven Method**: This solution is based on successful implementations from multiple sources in 2024

## Testing the Fix

To test the fixed workflow:

```bash
# Option 1: Trigger via tag push
git tag ios-v1.0.1
git push origin ios-v1.0.1

# Option 2: Manual trigger via GitHub UI
# Go to Actions → Mobile Builds (Fixed) → Run workflow → Select 'ios'
```
