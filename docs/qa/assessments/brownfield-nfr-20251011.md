## NFR 1: Security

### Status: CONCERNS

### Evidence

**Strengths**:
- ✅ Domain-based role assignment pattern (@roselleschools.org → teacher, @rosellestudent.org → student)
- ✅ Comprehensive Firestore security rules (797 lines)
- ✅ Role-based access control (RBAC) throughout
- ✅ Multi-provider authentication (Email, Google, Apple, Username)
- ✅ Firebase Auth integration with domain validation
- ✅ Immutable audit trails for behavior points and messages

**Concerns**:
- ⚠️ **Firestore Rules Complexity**: 797 lines with duplication and redundancy
  - Multiple role-checking functions with similar logic
  - Complex enrollment validation patterns repeated
  - Difficult to maintain and validate comprehensively
  - Location: `firestore.rules`

- ⚠️ **No Automated Security Testing**: Rules tested manually only
  - No @firebase/rules-unit-testing implementation
  - Manual testing prone to gaps
  - Security regressions not automatically detected

- ⚠️ **Input Sanitization Gaps**: Message content sanitization present but coverage unknown
  - XSS prevention implemented (BF-UNIT-014 test designed)
  - No comprehensive input validation testing across all forms
  - Location: `lib/features/chat/domain/models/message.dart`

### Targets

| Requirement | Current State | Target | Evidence |
|-------------|---------------|--------|----------|
| Authentication mechanism | ✅ Multi-provider | ✅ Maintained | Firebase Auth with 4 providers |
| Authorization checks | ✅ RBAC implemented | ✅ Maintained | Firestore rules enforce roles |
| Input validation | ⚠️ Partial | ✅ Comprehensive | Chat sanitization present |
| Secret management | ✅ Environment vars | ✅ Maintained | .env file not in git |
| Rate limiting | ❌ Not implemented | ⚠️ Future | No rate limiting on auth endpoints |
| Security rules testing | ❌ Not implemented | ✅ Automated | Need @firebase/rules-unit-testing |

### Gaps Identified

1. **No Rate Limiting** (Medium Severity)
   - Risk: Brute force attacks possible on auth endpoints
   - Impact: Account compromise, service degradation
   - Fix: Add rate limiting middleware to auth service
   - Estimate: 2 hours
   - Test: BF-INT-006 validates rate limits

2. **Firestore Rules Complexity** (High Severity)
   - Risk: Security gaps in complex rule logic
   - Impact: Unauthorized data access
   - Fix: Refactor rules for reusability, implement automated testing
   - Estimate: 2 weeks
   - Test: BF-UNIT-024 to BF-UNIT-026, BF-INT-035 to BF-INT-041

3. **Input Validation Coverage Unknown** (Medium Severity)
   - Risk: XSS or injection attacks in uncovered forms
   - Impact: User data compromise
   - Fix: Comprehensive input validation testing
   - Estimate: 1 week
   - Test: BF-INT-055 validates ValidationService

### Quality Score Impact

- **Current**: 80/100 (CONCERNS due to complexity and lack of automated testing)
- **After Mitigation**: 95/100 (PASS with refactored rules and automated tests)

**Deterministic Calculation**:
- Base: 100
- -10 for Firestore rules complexity (CONCERNS)
- -10 for no automated security testing (CONCERNS)
- = 80/100 (CONCERNS threshold)

## Key Principles

- ✅ **Core Four NFRs**: Security, Performance, Reliability, Maintainability (primary focus)
- ✅ **Deterministic Status Rules**: Clear thresholds for FAIL/CONCERNS/PASS
- ✅ **Quality Score Calculation**: Weighted average with business criticality
- ✅ **Actionable Findings**: All gaps have specific fixes and estimates
- ✅ **Unknown Targets → CONCERNS**: Missing SLAs marked as concerns, not guesses
- ✅ **Gate-Ready Output**: YAML block formatted for direct integration
