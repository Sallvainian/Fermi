## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. [TECH-001]: Minimal Test Coverage (<5%)

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High (3) - Already confirmed (only 1 unit test file exists)
**Impact**: High (3) - Severe consequences for refactoring safety and regression prevention

**Detailed Analysis**:
- Current state: Only `test/unit/firestore_thread_safe_test.dart` exists
- No widget tests, minimal integration tests, no E2E tests
- Manual testing is primary QA method
- Creates extreme risk for any refactoring or optimization work

**Affected Components**:
- All features (assignments, auth, behavior_points, calendar, chat, classes, etc.)
- Shared services layer
- State management (Provider implementations)
- Platform abstraction layers

**Mitigation**:
- **Immediate Actions**:
  - Implement unit tests for critical paths: authentication, class management, assignment submission
  - Add integration tests for key user flows
  - Target 40% coverage within first sprint, 70% within quarter
- **Preventive Controls**:
  - Enforce test coverage requirements in CI/CD (minimum 60% for new code)
  - Implement pre-commit hooks requiring tests for new features
  - Use test-driven development (TDD) for critical components
- **Testing Requirements**:
  - Unit tests: All service layer methods
  - Widget tests: All feature presentation layers
  - Integration tests: Auth flow, assignment lifecycle, grading workflow
  - E2E tests: Critical user journeys with Patrol framework

**Residual Risk**: Medium - Historical code remains untested until retrofit complete
**Owner**: Development team
**Timeline**: Phase 1 (immediate) - Critical paths within 2 weeks

### 2. [DATA-001]: Database Collection Naming Inconsistency

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High (3) - Already confirmed in production
**Impact**: High (3) - Data synchronization failures, query complexity

**Detailed Analysis**:
- Dual collections: `chatRooms` (camelCase) AND `chat_rooms` (snake_case)
- Firestore rules support both for backward compatibility
- Increases query complexity and potential for data sync issues
- Creates confusion in codebase maintenance

**Affected Components**:
- `lib/features/chat/data/` - Chat services
- `firestore.rules` - Security rules maintain both conventions
- All chat-related queries and UI components

**Mitigation**:
- **Immediate Actions**:
  - Audit all existing chat data across both collections
  - Create migration script to consolidate to single convention (recommend `chat_rooms` for consistency with `discussion_boards`)
  - Implement read-from-both, write-to-new pattern during transition
- **Preventive Controls**:
  - Establish naming convention standard (snake_case for all collections)
  - Add pre-commit linting to enforce collection naming
  - Document naming conventions in architecture guide
- **Testing Requirements**:
  - Migration script validation with test data
  - Dual-read verification during transition period
  - Post-migration data integrity checks
  - Rollback procedure testing

**Residual Risk**: Low - After migration complete and verified
**Owner**: Backend/Infrastructure team
**Timeline**: Phase 1 - Migration plan within 1 week, execution within 2 weeks

## High Risks Requiring Attention

### 3. [TECH-002]: Duplicate Code Patterns and Components

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium (2) - Confirmed duplicates exist
**Impact**: High (3) - Maintenance burden, inconsistent behavior risk

**Identified Duplicates**:
- Auth providers in TWO locations: `lib/features/auth/providers/` AND `lib/features/auth/presentation/providers/`
- Assignment models: `assignment.dart` AND `assignment_model.dart`
- Features: `student/` and `students/` folders (relationship unclear)
- OAuth handlers: 3 variants (default, direct, secure) without clear delineation

**Mitigation**:
- Consolidate auth providers to single authoritative location
- Merge or clarify assignment model purpose
- Document student vs students folder purpose or consolidate
- Determine canonical OAuth handler and remove unused variants
- **Testing**: Regression tests before and after consolidation

**Timeline**: Phase 2 - Refactoring sprint

---

### 4. [SEC-001]: Complex Firestore Security Rules (797 lines)

---

## Conclusion

The Fermi Plus brownfield architecture exhibits **HIGH RISK (34/100)** primarily due to:
1. **Critical lack of test coverage** - Extreme refactoring risk
2. **Database inconsistency** - Active data integrity concern
3. **Missing staging environment** - Production testing risk

**Immediate Actions Required (This Week)**:
- âœ… Begin test implementation for authentication and class management
- âœ… Create staging Firebase environment
- âœ… Audit and plan database naming migration

**The system is functional but fragile**. Any significant refactoring or optimization work carries extreme risk without addressing test coverage first. The recommended phased approach prioritizes stabilization before architectural improvements.

**Gate Recommendation**: FAIL for major refactoring work until critical risks (TECH-001, DATA-001, OPS-001) are mitigated to acceptable levels.

---

**Next Steps**:
1. Review and approve risk assessment with stakeholders
2. Prioritize Phase 1 stabilization work in sprint planning
3. Allocate resources for test development and staging setup
4. Schedule weekly risk review meetings
5. Create tracking dashboard for risk metrics

**Risk Profile Will Be Updated**: After Phase 1 completion, major architecture changes, or security incidents.
