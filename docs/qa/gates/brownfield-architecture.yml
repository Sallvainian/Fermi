# ============ Notes ============
notes: |
  This quality gate assessment is based on comprehensive brownfield architecture analysis.

  The Fermi Plus application is a functional production system serving its users effectively.
  However, the rapid MVP development approach ("vibe-coded") has resulted in significant
  technical debt that must be addressed before major refactoring or optimization work.

  The FAIL gate status is advisory and protective - it signals that the current codebase
  lacks the safety nets (tests, staging environment) required to confidently make changes.

  The recommended phased approach prioritizes stabilization (Phase 1) before architectural
  improvements (Phase 2-3). This minimizes risk while establishing a sustainable foundation
  for ongoing development.

  Key Success Factors:
  - Test-driven development for all new features
  - Incremental improvement rather than big-bang refactoring
  - Continuous risk monitoring and mitigation
  - Regular gate status reviews and adjustments

  The team should view this as a roadmap rather than criticism - these issues are common
  in successful MVP products that evolved rapidly to meet user needs. The path forward
  is clear and achievable with systematic execution.
