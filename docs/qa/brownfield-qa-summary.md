# Fermi Plus Brownfield Architecture - QA Assessment Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-11
**Reviewer**: Quinn (Test Architect)
**Assessment Scope**: Complete brownfield architecture analysis, risk profiling, and test design

---

## Executive Summary

The Fermi Plus application has been comprehensively assessed for quality assurance readiness. The analysis reveals a **functional production system** that successfully serves its users, but carries significant technical debt from rapid MVP development that creates **HIGH RISK (34/100)** for refactoring work.

**Gate Decision**: **FAIL** - Stabilization required before major optimization work

**Critical Findings**:
- Test coverage <5% (only 1 unit test file)
- Database naming inconsistency (chatRooms vs chat_rooms)
- No staging environment (dev → production deployment)
- 67 test scenarios designed to establish 70% coverage baseline

**Path Forward**: 12-week phased stabilization and improvement program

- **Overall Risk Score**: 34/100 (HIGH RISK)
- **Risk-Based Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive mitigation plans
- **Phased Risk Reduction**: Target 75/100 by end of Phase 3

**Critical Risks**:

### 3. Quality Gate File
**File**: `docs/qa/gates/brownfield-architecture.yml` (518 lines)

**Gate Status**: **FAIL**

**Status Reason**: "Critical risks identified: <5% test coverage and database inconsistency create extreme refactoring risk. Stabilization required before major optimization work."

**Top Issues** (High Severity):
1. **TECH-001**: Test coverage <5% - Implement P0 tests targeting 40% minimum
2. **DATA-001**: Database inconsistency - Execute migration with zero data loss
3. **OPS-001**: No staging environment - Create staging Firebase project

**Gate Conditions to PASS**:
- ✅ Test coverage ≥40% on critical paths
- ✅ P0 test scenarios implemented (28 tests)
- ✅ Staging environment operational
- ✅ Database migration validated
- ✅ All critical risks mitigated

**Success Criteria by Phase**:
- **Phase 1**: Risk score ≥55/100, 40% coverage
- **Phase 2**: Risk score ≥65/100, 60% coverage
- **Phase 3**: Risk score ≥75/100, 70% coverage, Gate → PASS

### 4. Updated Architecture Document
**File**: `docs/brownfield-architecture.md` (updated)

**Changes**: Added comprehensive QA Assessment section with:
