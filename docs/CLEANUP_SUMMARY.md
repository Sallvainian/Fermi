# Project Cleanup Summary

Date: 2025-07-05

## Actions Taken

### 1. Relocated Test Files
Moved test utilities from `lib/` to `tools/` directory:
- `lib/test_db_simple.dart` → `tools/test_db_simple.dart`
- `lib/test_db_direct.dart` → `tools/test_db_direct.dart`
- `lib/setup_test_data.dart` → `tools/setup_test_data.dart`

These files contain standalone applications with their own `main()` functions and should not be in the main application library.

### 2. Updated .gitignore
Added the following entries:
- Debug logs (`pglite-debug.log`, `*.log`)
- Personal scripts (`launch_app.sh`)
- Temporary images in root directory (`/*.png`, `/*.jpg`, etc.)
- Android build artifacts (`android/android/`, `android/init.gradle`)

Note: AI assistant directories (`.claude/`, `.cursor/`, `.gemini/`) were already present in .gitignore.

### 3. Cleaned Up Files
- Removed `pglite-debug.log` from root directory
- Created `tools/README.md` to document the purpose of the tools directory

## Benefits

1. **Cleaner Project Structure**: Test utilities are now properly separated from production code
2. **Better Version Control**: Unnecessary files are now excluded from git
3. **Improved Organization**: Clear separation between application code and development tools
4. **Professional Codebase**: Follows Flutter/Dart best practices for project organization

## Next Steps

1. Review and commit these changes
2. Ensure all team members are aware of the new tools directory
3. Consider adding more development scripts to the tools directory as needed
4. Regularly review .gitignore to ensure it stays up to date
