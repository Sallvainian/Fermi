## Risk Management

### Common Blockers & Solutions

#### Authentication Issues
**Risk**: Role detection fails
**Solution**: Hardcode teacher role initially, fix later

#### Firebase Limits
**Risk**: Hit free tier limits
**Solution**: Optimize queries, batch operations

#### Platform Issues
**Risk**: iOS build problems
**Solution**: Focus on Android/Web first

#### Time Overrun
**Risk**: Features take longer
**Solution**: Cut nice-to-haves, focus on core

### Technical Risks
1. **Platform compatibility issues**
   - Mitigation: Test early on all platforms
2. **Firebase service limits**
   - Mitigation: Monitor usage, optimize queries
3. **Performance issues**
   - Mitigation: Regular profiling, optimization
