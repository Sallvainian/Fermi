# Deployment & CI/CD Workflow Analysis

## Session: 2025-01-08 00:35:00

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Assessment

#### Current Workflow Analysis

## Workflows to Consolidate (Keep iOS)

### 1. **CONSOLIDATE: Build Workflows**
Currently have overlapping build workflows:
- `build.yml` - Basic build (needs fixing)
- `flutter-ci.yml` - Flutter CI with tests
- `android-build.yml` - Android-specific build
- `pr-checks.yml` - PR validation checks

**Recommendation**: Merge into unified `ci.yml` that handles all platforms

### 2. **KEEP & IMPROVE: iOS Workflows**
Maintain iOS support but optimize:
- `ios-build.yml` - Keep for iOS CI/CD
- `ios-compatibility-test.yml` - Keep for Xcode compatibility
- `ios-deploy.yml` - Keep for TestFlight deployment
- `ios-development.yml` - Keep for dev builds
**Note**: These will run but won't block Android/Web progress

### 3. **CONSOLIDATE: Deployment Workflows**
Current deployment is fragmented:
- `simple-deploy.yml` - Basic Firebase hosting
- `web-deploy.yml` - Complex web deployment
- `release.yml` - Full release workflow

**Recommendation**: Unified `deploy.yml` with platform-specific jobs

## Recommended Consolidated Structure

### Files to Remove
- `build.yml` (replace with ci.yml)
- `flutter-ci.yml` (merge into ci.yml)
- `pr-checks.yml` (merge into ci.yml)
- `simple-deploy.yml` (merge into deploy.yml)

### Files to Keep/Create
- `ci.yml` (new - consolidated CI)
- `deploy.yml` (new - unified deployment)
- `android-build.yml` (keep but simplify)
- `web-deploy.yml` (keep but simplify)
- All iOS workflows (keep as-is)
- Claude workflows (keep as-is)
- `dependency-update.yml` (keep with improvements)
- `release.yml` (keep for version releases)

### Status: Ready for implementation
### Next Steps: Create consolidated workflows while preserving iOS support
