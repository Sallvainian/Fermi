# Architecture Summary
# Teacher Dashboard Flutter Firebase

## Quick Reference Architecture

### System Overview
A pragmatic, non-enterprise educational platform for personal classroom management. Built with Flutter and Firebase for simplicity and rapid development with AI assistance.

### Core Architecture Principles
1. **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**: No over-engineering
2. **YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)**: Build only what's needed
3. **SLC (Simple, Lovable, Complete)**: Focus on user value
4. **AI-First Development**: Leverage AI for 5-10x speed increase

### Technology Stack (Simplified)

#### Frontend
- **Flutter 3.24+**: Single codebase for all platforms
- **Material 3**: Modern, accessible UI
- **Riverpod 2.4+**: Simple state management

#### Backend
- **Firebase Auth**: User authentication
- **Cloud Firestore**: Real-time database
- **Cloud Functions**: Serverless compute
- **Cloud Storage**: File storage

#### Infrastructure
- **Firebase Hosting**: Web deployment
- **GitHub Actions**: Simple CI/CD
- **Single Environment**: No dev/staging/prod complexity

### Architecture Layers (Simplified)

```

### Data Architecture

#### Firestore Collections
```
/users/{userId}
  - profile data
  - role (teacher/student)
  
/classes/{classId}
  - class info
  - teacher reference
  
/students/{studentId}
  - student info
  - class references
  
/assignments/{assignmentId}
  - assignment details
  - due dates
  
/submissions/{submissionId}
  - student work
  - grades
```

### Security Model

#### Simple Role-Based Access
- **Teacher**: Full access to class data
- **Student**: Read access to own data
- **Parent**: View-only access (future)

#### Firestore Rules (Simplified)
```javascript
// Teachers can manage their classes
match /classes/{classId} {
  allow read, write: if isTeacher();
}

// Students can view their data
match /students/{studentId} {
  allow read: if request.auth.uid == studentId;
  allow write: if isTeacher();
}
```

### Performance Targets (Realistic)

#### For Small Classroom (30 students)
- Load time: < 3 seconds
- Concurrent users: 30-50
- Database reads: < 50K/month (free tier)
- Storage: < 5GB (free tier)
- Functions invocations: < 125K/month (free tier)

### Development Sequence
- **Step 1**: Setup & Authentication
- **Step 2**: Core CRUD operations
- **Step 3**: Assignment & Grading
- **Step 4**: Testing & Deployment


### Deployment Strategy

#### Simple Single-Environment
1. Push to main branch
2. GitHub Actions builds
3. Auto-deploy to Firebase
4. No complex staging/production

### Monitoring (Basic)

#### What to Track
- Login failures
- Slow queries (> 1s)
- Error rate
- Active users

#### Tools
- Firebase Console (free)
- GitHub Actions logs
- Browser console for debugging

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

#### Don't Build
- Microservices
- Complex caching layers
- Multiple environments
- Custom authentication
- Complex state management
- Over-abstracted code

#### Keep It Simple
- Direct Firebase calls
- Simple folder structure
- Minimal abstractions
- Basic error handling
- Standard Flutter patterns

### Success Criteria

#### Technical Success
- Works on Android, iOS, Web
- < 3 second load time
- No critical bugs
- 99% uptime

#### User Success
- Teachers save 2+ hours/week
- Students submit work easily
- Parents can view progress
- Works on all devices

### Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Start with auth
2. **Day 1**: Basic CRUD
3. **Day 2**: Core features
4. **Day 3**: Testing
5. **Day 4**: Deploy

### Remember

This is a **personal tool** for **your classroom**, not an enterprise app. Keep it simple, use AI to code faster, and focus on what actually helps you teach better.

## Session: CLAUDE.md Enhancement - 2025-01-10

### Phase 1: Research Findings

#### Industry Best Practices for CLAUDE.md
- **Location**: Root directory, auto-loaded by Claude Code
- **Format**: Concise, human-readable Markdown
- **Key Content**: Tech stack, architecture, commands, workflows, guidelines
- **Emphasis**: Use IMPORTANT, MUST, SHOULD for critical instructions
- **Structure**: Modular sections - context, rules, steps, examples

#### Effective Documentation Patterns
1. **Clear Tech Stack Overview**: List all technologies with versions
2. **Key Files Index**: Enumerate critical files with purposes
3. **Explicit Rules**: Use MUST/SHOULD/SHOULD NOT terminology
4. **Clarifying Questions**: Explicitly instruct AI to ask when unclear
5. **Workflow Examples**: Provide concrete step-by-step scenarios

#### Claude Code CLI Optimization
- Use custom commands in .claude/commands/
- Leverage /init for auto-generation
- Implement cost optimization through context management
- Utilize # prefix for quick memory additions
- Apply emphasis (IMPORTANT, YOU MUST) for better adherence

#### Flutter-Specific Best Practices
- Document Clean Architecture layers clearly
- Include Firebase integration specifics
- Provide testing command examples
- Explain state management approach
- List routing and authentication flows
